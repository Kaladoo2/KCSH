# KCSH
KCSH is a small **ClientSide Action Hub** with various actions in production and in development, if you somehow managed to stumble across this through github or a browser you can load it with:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/N4MUG2Rn"))()
```

When you die it doesnt come back so you would need to re run it, no idea why but when I set reset on spawn to true it justs breaks when I try to use the same GUI.

**Have fun!**
